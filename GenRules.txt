MOST IMPORTANT: FIRSTLY COUNT THE NUMBER OF SEGMENTS.Each composition must strictly contain 17, 33, 49 or 65 segments. Else, ask for re-composition.
Each compostion must have a variety of bols (words), and not the same two or three bols. 
It is okay to also include pauses ('-') in the composition (only if needed). 
A segment with just pauses ('-') must not contain more than one pause. 
Tihais and Chakkardar usually ends with bols such as 'dha', 'thei', 'tha'. They consist of a set of patterns repeated three times.
Tukdas usually end with bols such as 'dha', 'thei', 'tha', etc.
As you can see, Sam se sam Tukdas have exactly 17 beats, no more, no less.
