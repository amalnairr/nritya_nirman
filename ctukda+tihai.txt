Chakkardar Tukdas have 16n+1 beats, where n is an integer. They could end with bol like ‘dha’, ‘thei’, ‘tha’ etc. but could also end on a number. However the most important criteria is that the same set of bol is repeated thrice while maintaining the 16n + 1 structure as a whole. It does not matter if each of the three repetitions have a 16n+1 structure individually, they just need to have that when put together. You can count the number of beats by seeing how many pipes (|) are present and then add 1 to it.
