Tihais have 16n + 1 beats.
Each beat is counted only when it is separated by a pipe symbol (|).
Tihais can be regular with bols like ta, tha, dha, etc. or they can be ginti ki tihai with numbers and spaces.
Calculate the number of beats by counting the number of pipes (|)
Each cycle of beats starts and ends at the same bol, and has cycles repeating thrice, for example:
tha thei thei tat | aa thei thei tat | thei ta | thei tha thei |
thei tat aa thei | thei tat thei | tha thei | tha thei thei tat |
aa thei thei tat | thei ta | thei | tha thei thei tat |
aa thei thei tat | thei ta | thei tha thei | thei tat aa thei |
thei tat thei | tha thei | tha thei thei tat | aa thei thei tat |
thei ta | thei | tha thei thei tat | aa thei thei tat |
thei ta | thei tha thei | thei tat aa thei | thei tat thei |
