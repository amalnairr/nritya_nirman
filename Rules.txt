Tihais have 16n + 1 beats. Tihais can be regular with bols like ta, tha, dha, etc. or they can be ginti ki tihai with numbers and spaces.
Each cycle of beats starts and ends at the same bol, and has cycles repeating thrice, for example:
tha thei thei tat | aa thei thei tat | thei ta | thei tha thei |
thei tat aa thei | thei tat thei | tha thei | tha thei thei tat |
aa thei thei tat | thei ta | thei | tha thei thei tat |
aa thei thei tat | thei ta | thei tha thei | thei tat aa thei |
thei tat thei | tha thei | tha thei thei tat | aa thei thei tat |
thei ta | thei | tha thei thei tat | aa thei thei tat |
thei ta | thei tha thei | thei tat aa thei | thei tat thei |
tha thei | tha thei thei tat | aa thei thei tat | thei ta |
thei

Tukdas are similar, but they usually just repeat for once cycle and have 16(1) + 1, i.e. 17 beats.
In unusal cases, they can have 16n + 1 beats and they repeat thrice.
